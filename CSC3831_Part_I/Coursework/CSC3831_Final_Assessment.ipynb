    "Ce coursework a permis de combiner les différentes méthodes que nous avons pu aborder en cours et testé en practical. Sachant que nous avons vu différentes méthodes pour chaque actions, il a donc fallu faire des choix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Concernant l'anomaly detection, j'ai choisi z-score comme méthode statistique et Isolation Forest comme méthode algorithmique. J'ai choisi z-score car c'est une méthode simple et rapide à mettre en place, mais elle est limitée par l'assumption de normalité des données. Pour cela j'ai tenté d'utiliser robust z-score que nous avons pu aborder en classe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isolation Forest est plus robuste car elle ne fait pas d'assumption sur la distribution des données. Cependant, elle est plus complexe à mettre en place et nécessite de trouver le bon paramètre de contamination. Isolation Forest est plus adaptée pour des données de petite taille, ce qui est à la fois un avantage et un inconvénient. J'ai tenté de faire au mieux à partir de mes recherches personnelle et les connaissances fournies en cours. Je serai très heureux d'avoir des retours sur mes choix et mes résultats. Je ne sais pas comment fonctionne les retours en angleterre étant donné que je suis un étudiant en échange universitaire français venu pour ma troisième année.\n",

    "Pour l'imputation, j'ai choisi KNN et MICE (IterativeImputer). KNN and MICE are both multivariate imputation algorithms. I found some advantages and disadvantages of KNN on this website[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages\n",
    "- Enhances Data Accuracy (tries to fill NaN with accurate values)\n",
    "- Preserves Data Structure (maintains the relationships and distribution of the data as shown in the above plot)\n",
    "- Handles Numeric Data Effectively (int/float dtypes, where it can make accurate estimations for missing values.)\n",
    "- Integration with Scikit-Learn (easy to integrate with data preprocessing pipeline)\n",
    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "- Sensitive to the Choice of k (selecting an inappropriate value for k may lead to either over-smoothing (too generalized) - or overfitting (too specific) imputations). In our case, we used the default value of k=5. I tried to find the best value for k, trying with 7, 3 and 1, but I found 5 to be the best value.\n",
    "- Highly Computational (can be time-consuming for larger datasets to calculate the distance between two data points)\n",
    "- Handling Categorical Data (imputing discrete values can be challenging, but KNN Imputer remains applicable when the data is encoded) In our case, It doesn't matter because we only have numerical data.\n",
    "- Impact of Outliers (too many outliers in the data may lead to wrong imputations)\n",
