    "This coursework allowed us to combine the different methods that we were able to approach in class and tested in practice. Knowing that we saw different methods for each action, we had to make choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Anomaly detection choice\n",
    "\n",
    "## Z-score\n",
    "Concerning anomaly detection, I chose z-score as a statistical method and Isolation Forest as an algorithmic method. I chose z-score because it is a simple and quick method to set up, but it is limited by the assumption of normality of the data. For this I tried to use robust z-score that we were able to approach in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Isolation Forest\n",
    "Isolation Forest is more robust because it does not make assumptions about the distribution of the data. However, it is more complex to set up and requires finding the right contamination parameter. Isolation Forest is more suitable for small data, which is both an advantage and a disadvantage. I tried to do my best based on my personal research and the knowledge provided in class. I would be very happy to have feedback on my choices and results. I do not know how feedback works in England since I am a French university exchange student here for my third year.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Imputer choice\n",
    "For imputation, I chose KNN and MICE (IterativeImputer). KNN and MICE are both multivariate imputation algorithms. I found some advantages and disadvantages of KNN on this website[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## KNN Impute:\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Enhances Data Accuracy (tries to fill NaN with accurate values)\n",
    "- Preserves Data Structure (maintains the relationships and distribution of the data as shown in the above plot)\n",
    "- Handles Numeric Data Effectively (int/float dtypes, where it can make accurate estimations for missing values.)\n",
    "- Integration with Scikit-Learn (easy to integrate with data preprocessing pipeline)\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Sensitive to the Choice of k (selecting an inappropriate value for k may lead to either over-smoothing (too generalized) - or overfitting (too specific) imputations). In our case, we used the default value of k=5. I tried to find the best value for k, trying with 7, 3 and 1, but I found 5 to be the best value.\n",
    "- Highly Computational (can be time-consuming for larger datasets to calculate the distance between two data points)\n",
    "- Handling Categorical Data (imputing discrete values ​​can be challenging, but KNN Imputer remains applicable when the data is encoded) In our case, It doesn't matter because we only have numerical data.\n",
    "- Impact of Outliers (too many outliers in the data may lead to wrong imputations)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## MICE Impute:\n",
    "Based on these website[2, 3], here are some advantages and disadvantages of the MICE algorithm:\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "- Flexibility:\n",
    "MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations) is highly flexible and can be applied to datasets with various types of variables, including binary, categorical, and continuous data. It allows each variable to be modeled according to its specific distribution, enhancing the accuracy of imputations1.\n",
    "- Handling Complex Datasets:\n",
    "MICE can be used effectively in large datasets with hundreds of variables, making it suitable for complex data structures where traditional joint models may not be appropriate1.\n",
    "- Uncertainty Quantification:\n",
    " By generating multiple imputations for each missing value, MICE accounts for the uncertainty inherent in missing data, leading to more accurate standard errors and reducing the risk of false precision that can occur with single imputation methods3.\n",
    "- Auxiliary Variables:\n",
    " The method allows the inclusion of auxiliary variables that are not part of the main analysis but can improve the quality of imputations by making the Missing At Random (MAR) assumption more plausible1.\n",
    "- Superefficiency: MICE can sometimes provide more precise statistical inferences than maximum likelihood methods by using additional information that may not be accessible to the analyst2.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "- Assumption of MAR:\n",
    " MICE assumes that data are Missing At Random (MAR), meaning the probability of missingness depends only on observed values. If this assumption is violated, it can lead to biased estimates13.\n",
    "- Complex Implementation:\n",
    "The method is more complex to implement compared to simpler imputation techniques. It requires careful consideration in setting up the imputation model and validating the quality of generated data24.\n",
    "- Potential for Misleading Results:\n",
    " Without appropriate care and insight, MICE can yield nonsensical or misleading results. It requires scientific and statistical judgment at various stages, such as diagnosing the missing data problem and setting up a robust imputation model2.\n",
    "- Computational Expense:\n",
    " MICE can be computationally expensive, particularly with large datasets or when a high number of imputations is required to achieve stable results4.\n",
    "- Lack of Guidance for Complex Data Structures:\n",
    "There is limited guidance on how to incorporate design factors from complex sampling designs or how to handle nested, hierarchical, or autocorrelated data within the MICE framework2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difficulties encountered in implementing imputers was the interpretation of the results. Indeed I think that there are still unknowns in the method to follow for me. I want to practice this field to better understand and deepen the field. For this I am also taking the biomedical and AI course and I will also join the Formula Student club which aims to win a speed race with an autonomous electric vehicle on a circuit.\n",
